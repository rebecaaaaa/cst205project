Project Title: Hot Girlz Careers Flask App
Team: Stephanie Hernandez, Rebeca Chavez, Alexia Leon Lopez
Class: CST205
Date: 05/17/2021
Instructions: In order to run this app, it is best to have a virtual 
environment set up. Once you have all required documents in a directory,
run the Flask App on your terminal. The python file you will need to run is AppRoutes.py
commands will look like this: 
export FLASK_APP=AppRoutes.py >> export FLASK_DEBUG=1 >> flask run
Then copy and paste the link provided to your browser, and your app will be
visible and easy to navigate through.

Future Work: This project would hopefully expand to include more creative graphic design
and extra features, such as a social networking tab for users to make posts, 
similar to LinkedIn
